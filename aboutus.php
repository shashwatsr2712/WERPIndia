  <h3>  ABOUT US </h3>
    <p>
      WERP-India is a student initiative for women empowerment in India. A
research-based social enterprise for empowering all Indian Women through
social research and volunteering. About 50% of the world population is
women. Their contributions to wealth and asset creation are substantial and
can be inferred as same as that of men, though there is no precise estimate of
such macro variables on the basis of gender. Despite this, in almost all
societies, there is gender bias against women. The gender biases against
women start from the conception in the womb till lifetime. The war against
women is largely influenced by policies and issues of justice as well as the
social construct that influence the mindset of the public against women.
However, WERP-India has been born as a developmental project on the
multi-dimensional project approach to women empowerment in India through
social research techniques and volunteering. The social research project is
expected to facilitate the reconstruction of Indian society towards a
favourable mindset and appreciation for women and girls. It is noteworthy to
mention that Women are the core drivers of all sustainable development.
When a woman is empowered, the multiplier effect ripples down the family,
the community and the nation at large. Women, the nurture of nature and
nations.
